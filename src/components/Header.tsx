          <p className="text-sm md:text-base text-center">
            Welcome to the wildest word game around, where letters rule and rules are meant to be playfully broken! 
            Each player gets a letter and must whip up words using that very letter. Think you've got the chops? 
            Hold on tightâ€”if someone racks up too many points, everyone's in for a twist: a brand new letter is thrown into the mix!

            This game started as just a fun project (because why not?) and it's grown into a whirlwind of creative chaos. 
            Stay tuned for the GitHub repo link, where you can geek out over the code behind the madness. 
            Cheers, from yours truly, Windy.
